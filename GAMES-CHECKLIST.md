## Final Steps

## Your games-manifest.json Should Look Like:

```json
{
  "games": [
    {
      "id": "game-1",
      "title": "Game 1 Title",
      "folder": "game-1",
      "category": "Arcade",
      "image": "https://picsum.photos/seed/game1/600/400"
    },
    {
      "id": "game-2",
      "title": "Game 2 Title",
      "folder": "game-2",
      "category": "Action",
      "image": "https://picsum.photos/seed/game2/600/400"
    },
    {
      "id": "game-3",
      "title": "Game 3 Title",
      "folder": "game-3",
      "category": "Puzzle",
      "image": "https://picsum.photos/seed/game3/600/400"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quick Copy-Paste Template

Use this template for each game entry:

```json
{
  "id": "your-game-id",
  "title": "üéÆ Your Game Title",
  "folder": "your-game-id",
  "category": "Arcade",
  "image": "https://picsum.photos/seed/yourgame/600/400"
}
```

## Common Issues

**Game doesn't appear?**
- Check that folder name matches `"folder"` value in manifest
- Make sure file is named `index.html` (lowercase)
- Refresh the page with Ctrl+F5

**Game won't load?**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Make sure your HTML file doesn't have syntax errors
- Test the game URL directly

**Wrong thumbnail?**
- Change the seed in the image URL
- Or add your own: `"/games/your-game/thumbnail.png"`
